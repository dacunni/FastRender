# FastRender

These are not the bits you're looking for ...

Just a personal ray tracer project. Nothing to see here. Move along.

# Installing dependencies

I'm only really maintaining this on MacOS at the moment. The easiest way to install dependencies is through [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

```
brew install imagemagick
brew install assimp
```

# Building

Pretty simple. `make`

# Running

Again, brain dead. `fr`

Note, there are some model files I use for testing. These aren't included here. I'll put links to them at some point.
